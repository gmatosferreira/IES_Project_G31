# StoreGO

**Group:** G31

The application has the purpose of managing an automated store, that is, an establishment that provides a shopping experience without payment boxes, by recognizing the products that a customer removed from the shelf and charging the moment he leaves the store.

Upon arriving at the supermarket, your entry into the store is detected and through the sensors distributed throughout the space, products are added to your virtual cart or removed if it lands again. After shopping is finished, there is nothing to do: just leave the store. Once outside the store the purchase is finalized.

This application is similar to Amazon's smart supermarket with the “Just Walk Out“ concept, with no queues and no checkouts.
All of this will be viewed through the web application for Employees and Managers, each with different permissions and possible actions.
